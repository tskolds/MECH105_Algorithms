# MECH105_Algorithms
### All of the MATLAB algorithms I wrote for MECH105.

This repository contains all of the MATLAB algorithm assignments from MECH105, a numerical methods class. These algorithm assignments are mostly MATLAB functions that complete tasks related to the content we learned in MECH105.

This includes algorithms that do the following:
* Editing a matrix
* Finding roots of a function
* LU Decomposition
* Numerical integration using Simpson's 1/3 Rule
* Linear Regression
