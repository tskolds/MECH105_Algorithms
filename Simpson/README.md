## Simpson
This performs numerical integration on a data set given by arrays x and y using Simpson's 1/3 Rule. If the data occurs over an odd number of intervals, a single application of the Trapezoidal Rule will be used over the last interval.

### Inputs:
* x: Vector containing the equally spaced independent variable
* y: Vector containing function values with respect to x (independent variable)
### Outputs:
* I: The calculated numerical integral value
