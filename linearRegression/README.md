## linearRegression
This performs linear regression on a data set given by x and y

### INPUTS:
* x: Array containing x values for data set
* y: Array containing y values for data set
### OUTPUTS:
* fX: Array containing x values with outliers removed
* fY: Array containing y values with outliers removed
* slope: The slope of the line y=mx+b found from linear regression
* intercept: The intercept of the line y=mx+b found from linear regression
* Rsquared: The Rsquared value

*Note: This algorithm is unfinished as it does not work with complicated data sets. It is a work in progress.*
